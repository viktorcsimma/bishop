# Rewrite rules for the `bishop` project.

# First, we specify how to handle Prelude.
prelude:
  implicit: true
  hiding:           # if implicit is true
    - seq
    - <
    - ">"           # this prints () for some reason without the quotation marks

  #using:           # if implicit is false
  #  - _+_
  #  - Num

#Then the rules themselves.
