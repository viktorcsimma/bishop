# Bishop

A continuation of Zachary Murray's previous work, getting until the definition of continuity.

## An exciting new thing

Check out the [agda2hs branch](https://github.com/viktorcsimma/bishop/tree/agda2hs)! It's a rewrite which makes the first half of the library compatible with [agda2hs](https://github.com/agda/agda2hs), and thus runnable to some extent.

The rewrite is done up until the definition of `e`.

Actually, it demonstrates that Bishop reals are not suitable for more complex exact-real aritmetic, because of the ineffectiveness of rational operations. See `investigation/investigation.txt` there.
